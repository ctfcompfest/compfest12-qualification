# Lost My Source

by prajnapras19

## Flag

```
COMPFEST12{Th1s_15_y0ur5_abcdef}
```

## Description
I made a program that works like a cipher, but my friend just accidentally erased the source code!
I forgot to make the decipher and I have erased the plaintext.
Can You help me recover the plaintext?

P.S.: The plaintext is in format [flag][key]

## Attachment
Di folder /share
* source
* encrypted.txt

## Difficulty
Easy - Medium

## Hint
- The first 10 characters of the flag is "COMPFEST12"
- The key has a pattern (it is relatively easy to guess)
